# Personal Portfolio

TODO: Add a link to the portfolio website

![Portfolio Website](https://github.com/IM-Deane/images/blob/main/assets/images/portfolio-main-image.jpg)

### Current Version : 1.0.7

## Description:

This project is my personal portfolio website. Its main purpose is to host my
projects at
[https://tristandeaneportfolio.com](https://tristandeaneportfolio.com).

The main users of this site will be potential employers and freelance clients.
Although, I'm sure i'll point my friends and family this way as well :)

A secondary outcome of this site is to learn more about Next.js and styled
components.

The site features all of the major sections you would expect from a portfolio.

### Sections/Features:

- _Responsive Navbar:_ The nav will collapse on smaller screens and mobile
  devices. The links in this bar lead to different sections of the _same page_.
  To access the project gallery, visitors must click the link in the spotlight
  section. My rational for this is that I would rather them see my 4 best
  projects before moving to the main gallery.

- _Hero banner_ with a CTA button

- _Project spotlight:_ Highlights the top 4 projects that demonstrate my skills.

- _Technologies:_ Outlines the various web development technologies i'm familiar
  with.

- _About:_ Provides visitors with a brief overview of who I am. The section will
  link to a separate about page that has a more indepth profile.

- _Personal Accomplishments:_ highlights my most relevant accomplishments. This
  includes the number of difficut projects i've completed (fullstack or
  otherwise), the number of freelance projects i've completed, my GPA (this will
  change once i've graduated), and another box which i've yet to add.
- _Footer:_ which includes my contact details and social media profiles. It also
  highlights an interesting fact about the technology i'm currently learning.

## Version History:

_Version 1.0.7:_

Updated the About section's extended bio. Modified the styling of the several
links to include better hover effects.

_Version 1.0.6:_

Changed the Nav logo and favicons to a laurel wreath.

_Version 1.0.5:_

Added the Game Library Manager app to the project spotlight.

This application utilizes the MERN stack and has further solidified my skillset.

_Version 1.0.4:_

_Major:_ Updated the site's nav logo and favicon. I think they represent my
personality a little bit more (I like wolves ::smile:: ).

_Minor:_ Fixed some small typos in the copy of the site.

_Version 1.0.3:_

_Major:_

Added the _Historical Figures_ website to the project gallery and spotlight.
This application demonstrates my ability to create a fullstack MERN project.

The site server is hosted on heroku while the client is hosted on netlify.

_Minor:_

- Updated the contact e-mail address to my personal email.

_Version 1.0.2:_

Added a go back home link to the project gallery page. Updated the text of the
project cards.

_Version 1.0.1:_

Updated the timeline write up to render content conditionally. Instead of
displaying the entire auther profile on page load, the user has the option of
reading more about me if they're curious.

I believe this update keeps my profile concise for those visitors who are just
scanning.

_Version 1.0.0:_

This version includes the landing page and a project gallery page.
